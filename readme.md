# _Galactic Age Calculator_

#### _Back-end logic for an application to calculate your age in various planet-years_

#### By _**Hugh Donkin**_

## Description

_A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. However, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. For instance, a solar year on Mercury lasts 88 days. Write an application that determines a user’s age based on a planet’s solar years. You will need to use the Javascript Date object._

| Behavior | Input | Output |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Mercury - Take an age and return it divided by 0.24 | 100 years | 416.666 years |
| Venus - Take an age and return it divided by 0.62 | 100 years | 161.290 |
| Mars - Take an age and return it divided by 1.88 | 100 years | 53.19 |
| Jupiter - Take an age and return it divided by 11.86 | 100 years | 8.431 |
| Given a base life expectancy, take an age, return the difference between their age and the base life expectancy | 100 years, 88 base | 12 years |
| Take the difference and convert it to years on Mercury, Venus, etc | 58 years | 241.66, 93.54, etc |
